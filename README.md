# Assignment 03 – TOPSIS Implementation

This repository contains the complete solution for Assignment 03, which focuses on implementing the TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) method. The assignment is divided into three parts, each demonstrating a different way of using the same algorithm.

---

## Part 1: Command-Line Implementation

In this part, the TOPSIS algorithm is implemented as a Python script that can be executed from the command line. The program takes an input CSV or Excel file along with weights and impacts, computes TOPSIS scores, and generates an output file containing the ranks.

## Part 2: Python Package
# Topsis-Sunita-102303814

In this part, the TOPSIS logic is converted into a Python package. The package follows standard Python packaging conventions and can be installed locally using pip. The package allows users to run TOPSIS directly through Python code or the command line. A user manual explaining installation and usage is provided in the README file.

## Part 3: Web Application with Email Support

In this part, a Flask-based web application is developed. Users can upload a data file, enter weights and impacts, and provide an email address. The application runs the TOPSIS algorithm on the server and generates the output file. Email functionality is implemented for demonstration purposes.

## Summary

- Part 1 demonstrates the core TOPSIS logic using a command-line program.
- Part 2 packages the TOPSIS logic into a reusable Python package.
- Part 3 extends the solution into a web-based application using Flask.

Together, these parts demonstrate multiple practical ways to implement and deploy the TOPSIS decision-making method.
